# Frontend Mentor - Manage landing page

Programmers Hub, this would be our first collaborative project 🥳
We would start with this simple project and work our way up
The goal here is to learn how to work as a team 🤝🏽 and help each other better understand these technologies

Technologies we would be using are all Vanilla (HTML, CSS, JS)
